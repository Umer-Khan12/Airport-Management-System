# Airport Management System
Simple airport management system created for a software engineering class final project.
Authors: Jackson Davis, Neel Nadoda, Pal Patel, Umer Khan, and Yi Zhang Lim

A basic GUI can be accessed by running src/AirportManagementSystem.java.
Many features have been coded and tested in separate files but haven't been implemented in the GUI.

The main purpose of this project was to get hands-on experience with collaborative software engineering practices such as Git branching,
merging, push/pull requests, Scrum, user stories and epics, unit and integration testing, etc.
